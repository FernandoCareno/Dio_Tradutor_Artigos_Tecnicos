            "Swarm Pattern\n",
            "Unlike the \"agents as tools\" pattern, the swarm pattern involves agents communicating and collaborating dynamically without a single orchestrator.\n",
            "The swarm maintains a shared context accessible to all agents, including information about other agents, inputs, outputs, and historical interactions.\n",
            "The Swarm class is imported, and the four agents are defined with maximum handoffs and repetitive handoff detection to prevent infinite loops.\n",
            "\"Repetitive handoff\" refers to the frequent, unnecessary transfer of a task or responsibility between different individuals, teams, systems, or network access points.\n",
            "Example:\n",
            "Writing a blog using four agents:\n",
            "Research agent: Conducts research.\n",
            "Creative agent: Creates content.\n",

            "Key Components of the Swarm Pattern\n",
            "Shared Context: All agents have access to a shared context.\n",
            "Dynamic Collaboration: Agents communicate and collaborate without a central orchestrator.\n",
            "Handoff Limits: Maximum interactions and repetitive handoff detection are set to prevent infinite loops.\n",
            "Unique Agent Involvement: Ensures that at least three unique agents are involved in the last handoff to maintain diversity and prevent repetitive interactions.\n",
            "Swarm Pattern in Action\n",
            "Task: Create a blog post explaining agentic AI and a summary for a social media post.\n",
            "Workflow:\n",

            "Creative Agent: Creates an engaging blog post.\n",
            "Summarizer Agent: Generates a social media summary.\n",
            "Iterative Process: The Summarizer Agent requests more details from the Creative Agent to create an effective summary.\n",
            "Final Output: The Summarizer Agent successfully creates both the blog post and the social media summary after 5 interactions.\n",
            "Swarm as a Tool\n",
            "The Swarm pattern can be used as a tool within a larger framework.\n",
